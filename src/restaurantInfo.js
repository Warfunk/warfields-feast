const about = `Warfield's Tacos is a place that is all about fun and delicious food.
          We have been providing Amazing tacos and burritos to local community
          since 2021. The idea was first concieved by Alexander Warfield Spencer
          in his parents kitchen. One night Warfield was eating tacos with his
          parents and decided that it was his destiny to provide tacos for the
          greater community.`;
